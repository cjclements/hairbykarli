					<h2>Karli&#39;s Story</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="story-text">
					As an outdoor adventurer by day and a stargazer by night, Karli was inspired by the beauty and wonder of Mother Nature, and believed she deserves to be treated with kindness. From her time in a corporate salon, Karli began to feel guilty that the industry was not doing their part in minimizing or recycling waste. The salon industry alone creates 877 pounds of waste each minute!
					<br><br>
					There had to be a better way, but she couldn&#39;t sacrifice her lavish taste in beauty services and cosmetics. With that in mind, Karli set out to create an elevated salon experience while reducing waste. As a salon owner, she aims to deliver the highest possible level of guest service while offering clean and sustainable products and services. By visiting Hair By Karli you are setting an example by your dedication to kindness toward our planet.
